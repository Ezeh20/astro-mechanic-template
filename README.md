## ðŸš€ Project Structure

```text
All components lives in the component folder

```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Build after your edits
To build the hostable folder, you need to run
```
npm run build
```
This will bundle the entire project which is ready for production in a dist folder. You can the host that folder anywhere you wish.
